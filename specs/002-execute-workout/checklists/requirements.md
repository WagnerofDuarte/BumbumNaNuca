# Specification Quality Checklist: Executar Treino

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Validation Date**: 2026-01-07

**Key Findings**:
- All 23 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- 5 user stories properly prioritized (P1-P3) with independent test criteria
- 8 measurable success criteria defined without implementation details
- 7 edge cases identified covering boundary conditions
- Dependencies clearly documented (3 items)
- Assumptions explicitly stated (7 items)

## Notes

- Specification meets all quality criteria
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No additional clarifications needed
